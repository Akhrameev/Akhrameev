👋 Hi, I’m @Akhrameev

 I’m an **experienced iOS Developer**: started from iOS 5 - and I'm still in!

👔 Worked for mobile apps for well-known IT-companies: [Picsart](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picsart-photo-editor-video/id587366035), [VK](https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%BA%D1%82%D0%B5-%D0%BC%D1%83%D0%B7%D1%8B%D0%BA%D0%B0-%D0%B8-%D0%B2%D0%B8%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%BE/id564177498), [Yandex](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yandex-navi-navigation-maps/id474500851), [Movavi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/movavi-clips-edit-video-editor/id1226251139), [OneTwoTrip](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/onetwotrip-hotels-and-flights/id811057180) - and more.

High skills in multimedia apps development:
* I've developed first version of [Movavi Clips](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/movavi-clips-edit-video-editor/id1226251139) video editor from scratch in 3 months. And then build a team to continue development faster.
* In [EFEKT](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/efekt-video-editor-maker/id1367644508) (part of Picsart) I worked on Metal video effects and async frame processing.
* In [Picsart](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picsart-photo-editor-video/id587366035) I've added audio functionality to video editor (also [Mubert](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mubert-ai-music-streaming/id1154429580) integration: generative audio using samples).
* In [Picsart](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/picsart-photo-editor-video/id587366035) my team implemented server-side Text-2-Image and AI Enhancement tools.
* 📹 Contributor in [VLC iOS app](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/vlc-media-player/id650377962).

Attention to details:
* accurate async code (in any language: Objective-C, Swift, C++ in [Yandex.Navigator](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yandex-navi-navigation-maps/id474500851));
* pixel-perfect UI;
* ability to investigate complicated issues even without access to code (in Sberbank Business Online issue was in private framework, in Movavi I've fixed AVPlayer behavior on iPad with iOS 9.3, in EFEKT we got black images on some Metal effects after Xcode update - and ready for more)!
