## 🚀 High-Impact Engineering

I don't just build UI; I architect systems that scale to billions.

* **[Qalti](https://qalti.com):** Architected a **gRPC video streaming pipeline** and solved main-thread deadlocks for an AI-testing platform.
* **[Picsart](https://picsart.com):** Led the mobile GenAI launch (**1 Billion+ uses**). Shipped in 3 weeks by pioneering a Combine-based architecture.
* **[Yandex.Navi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/yandex-navi-navigation-maps/id474500851):** Engineered a **C++ ad-placement engine** that drove 20% revenue growth via optimized native rendering.
* **[Rhino](https://rhino.com):** Built a stateless, high-reliability foreground service (Flutter) replacing manual ops for a fleet of armored cars.
* **[Movavi](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/movavi-clips-edit-video-editor/id1226251139):** Built the iOS video editor **from scratch** in 3 months using AVFoundation.

## 🔬 Deep Dive & R&D

* **Multimedia:** Integrated **Mubert AI** (generative audio) and contributed to the open-source **VLC** player for iOS.
* **Systems Debugging:**
  * Reverse-engineered private frameworks to fix **Sberbank** security crashes.
  * Debugged **Metal shader memory layouts** via hex editors to fix rendering regressions.
  * Fixed low-level **AVPlayer** bugs on specific iOS versions by manipulating C++ internals.
* **Optimization:** Consolidated 400+ Figma UI variations into a single programmable system at Picsart.
